# Stream-Query-Client

Stream-Query-Client is the easiest way to use Vectara's streaming query API in your JavaScript applications. Simply provide a query configuration and a callback to instantly receive stream updates.

## How it works

When executed, `streamQuery` sends a request to Vectara's streaming query API. As the endpoint returns data chunks to the browser, the supplied `onStreamUpdate` is executed with relevant data from the most recent chunk. You can then use this latest data in your application however you wish.

## Use it in your application

### Install Stream-Query-Client

```shell
npm install --save @vectara/stream-query-client
```

Then use it in your application like this:

```js
import {
  streamQuery,
  StreamUpdate,
  StreamQueryConfig,
} from "@vectara/stream-query-client";

/* snip */

const sendQuery = async () => {
  const configurationOptions: StreamQueryConfig = {
    // configuration properties
  };

  const onStreamUpdate = (update: StreamUpdate) => {
    // perform operations on returned data, e.g. update state
  };

  streamQuery(configurationOptions, onStreamUpdate);
};
```

For more information on configuration options and callback types, see [the type definitions](src/types.ts) and our [Query API documentation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/stream-query).
